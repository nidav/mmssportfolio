  <p> Monash Marketing Students Society Est. 1971</p>

<p>
The Monash Marketing Studentsâ€™ Society (MMSS) is a student run university club that has been in operation since 1971.

While the focus of the society revolves primarily around marketing students, we represent a broader range of business and economics students with ambition and drive.

We are the biggest society on the Monash Caulfield campus, with a strong cohort of students.
We are renowned for providing a variety of events for social and career development. This is achieved through a strong and valued connection with a variety of organisations within the industry. In particular the MMSS is renowned for its Marketing Industry Development Scheme (MINDS), an industry focused initiative that aims to bridge the gap between university and employment for our valued members. </p>

<h6>Our Professional events</h6>
<p>
MMSS' Professional component is an initiative run by our dedicated team in partnership with the Department of Marketing and Monash Alumni. Our team strives to provide students and companies with a platform to network and share experiences. We believe Monash Marketers are the next wave of innovative, proactive and ambitious leaders. Through this we hope to provide them with opportunities to communicate these skills to their potential employers.
</p>

<h6>Our Social events</h6>
<p>
  The MMSS has been hosting some of the most popular and successful social events at Monash for over 40 years. We pride ourselves on providing our members and the wider student body with opportunities throughout the year to grow their social network and friendship group.
