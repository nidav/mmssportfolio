  <p> Monash Marketing Students Society Est. 1971</p>

<p>
The Monash Marketing Studentsâ€™ Society (MMSS) is a student run university club that has been in operation since 1971.

While the focus of the society revolves primarily around marketing students, we represent a broader range of business and economics students with ambition and drive.

We are the biggest society on the Monash Caulfield campus, with a strong cohort of students.
We are renowned for providing a variety of events for social and career development. This is achieved through a strong and valued connection with a variety of organisations within the industry. In particular the MMSS is renowned for its Marketing Industry Development Scheme (MINDS), an industry focused initiative that aims to bridge the gap between university and employment for our valued members. </p>
